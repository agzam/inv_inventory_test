INVENTORY APPLICATION

Create a single page application that provides a dashboard for inventory management.

Load the json data from the file: 
“data/inventory_data.json”


The workflow will consist of 3 parts: 

(1) Display a list of product categories (e.g. engineering, lab, informatics, and marketing) and aggregate data (total inventory, spent to date) for each category.
(2) Display a list of products for a selected category. 
(3) Display the detail for a selected product.

The product detail section displays the current product information and provides a mechanism for increasing or decreasing the "inStockCount". Increasing the stock count implies the product has been purchased and increases the "toDateSpent" accordingly.

Expected development time required is 2 - 3 hours. If you have any questions - please email us. 


Put your code in the following files:

- index.html
- css/
- js/

You may use any libraries you want (e.g. Angular, Backbone, Ember, Bootstrap, Foundation, etc.)
